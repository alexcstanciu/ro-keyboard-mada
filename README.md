# Romanian Programmers Keyboard for Mac

This keyboard layout provides the Romanian special characters as a combination of alt(option) and a, q, s, i, t keys.

Both `Madalina.icns` and `Madalina.keylayout` files should be copied to the `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` folder.

Alternatively, this command can be run:

```
sh <(curl -sL https://github.com/alexcstanciu/ro-keyboard-mada/raw/master/install.sh)
```
